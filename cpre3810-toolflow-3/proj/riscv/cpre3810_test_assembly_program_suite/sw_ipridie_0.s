# First test program will test sw by:
    # Moving the base address and store value across ALL registers
    # Moving the stored destination sparsely across the entire memory address range
    # Test the FRIST and LAST two accessible memory addresses
    # NO OFFSET YET

# REMEMBER: 
    # RISC-V memory instructions are byte addressable, but mem.vhd is word addressable
    # .text (program memory) starts at 0x1001.0000
    # Last reachable memory address of memory is 0x10010FFC
